# VHP4Safety Cloud Services

This webpage gives an overview of the VHP4Safety Cloud Services on the Production and
Development platforms. The second is where we develop and test cloud services, while the
first runs a stable version of the service.

### Production VHP4Safety Platform

There currently is not production platform yet.

### Development VHP4Safety Platform

The current development platform runs several services.

# Cloud catalog

VHP4Safety needs a cloud with a high diversity of services to support their case studies.
The services will run on but also outside the VHP4Safety cloud, on a case by case basis.

Below you find an overview of services available in the context of the VHP4Safety Platform.
[Additional services have been suggested](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/labels/service)
